Conduct
-------

There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions.  While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.
- Do not use exploits for your own gain, this tracker is up in goodwill to allow the public to help the dev team out with bug reporting.

Remember: PVKII is being developed in our freetime, and therefore your issue might not be reviewed/resolved immediately. Please be patient.


Reporting Issues
----------------

If you encounter a bug while using PVKII, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/Octoshark/pvkii/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.


If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

- a short, descriptive title;
- your game version (can be found by hovering your mouse over the PVKII logo in the main menu)
- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the console/command line;
- steps for reproducing the issue; and
- your [system information](#system-information).

Please place logs either in a code block (press `M` in your browser for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).

### System information

Your system information must include:
- your Linux distro or OS version
- your Desktop/Window Manager (Linux only)
- your Graphics card info (manufacturer, card version), any and all graphics driver versions
- anything else that you think may be useful (mouse/keyboard, filesystem type, etc).

The preferred and easiest way to get this information is from Steam's Hardware Information viewer from the menu (`Help -> System Information`).

Once your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`.
Paste this information into your report, preferably in a code block or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).
